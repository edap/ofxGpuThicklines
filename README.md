# ofxGpuThicklines

VBO-based rendering of thick lines, inspired by and based on Paul Houx' geometry shader for line drawing as found in the [Cinder forums](https://forum.libcinder.org/topic/smooth-thick-lines-using-geometry-shader).

The code was modified to be more efficient and ported to modern OpenGL.
