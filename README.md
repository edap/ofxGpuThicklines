ofxGpuCurves
================

This OpenFrameworks addon allows you to render thousands of Catmull-Rom splines in real-time. 
These are the same curves that are generated by using `ofCurveVertices()` or `ofPath::curveTo()`. Since everything happens on the GPU, drawing is much faster compared to vanilla OpenFrameworks.
